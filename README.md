# Discord-Server-Deleter
Tired of deleting your unused channels one by one manually? This simple Python script will help you do it within seconds.

Scripted by LatteBad#0406, idea from NotSaksh#6969.

Run the main.py file, input your token and target server ID, then choose what you want to delete.

**MAKE SURE BOTH main.py AND deleter.py FILES ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY**
